# Canvas-Bot

Disclaimer:
This bot is not for personal usage in its current state. 

Problem:
How can we make a more efficient method to keep track of academic tasks through 
means of using a social platform?

Solution:
Due to the higher usage of Discord for communicating between students, caused by
recent pandemic and even before the pandemic, our group is creating a Discord bot 
that allows users to either add to their server or use  personally to keep 
themselves on track with their current academic assignments though messages from 
the bot.

Ideas:
- Use python to make a bot
    - Issues:
        - Being able make a secret .py file
        - Bot cannot be used per class
            - More work for the user to set up the bot
        - Not everyones assignment is due on the same time

- Make functions in the back-end to be used in bot commands
    - Simple functions

- Have the bot display the upcoming assignments and the due dates for registered
classes.
