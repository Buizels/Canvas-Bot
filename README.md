Problem:
How can we make a more efficient method to keep track of academic tasks through 
means of using a social platform?

Solution:
Due to the higher usage of Discord for communicating between students, caused by

that allows users to either add to their server or use  personally to keep 
themselves on track with their current academic assignments though messages from 
the bot.

Ideas:
- Use python to make a bot
